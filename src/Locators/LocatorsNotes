Relative Xpath is preferred bc you can directly go to the one tag and identify it from there. its unique and narrowed down.

Issue with Absolute xpath is: a developers adds or removes, then that xpath will break

Difference b/w absolute and relative xpath

1.Absolute xpath starts with 1 slash while Relative starts with 2 // slashes

2.Absolute - starts at root node starting from the top note (html) while relative xpath you can start from anywhere in the DOM.

3.Absolute xpath - you can only go forward while relative xpath you can go up and down the elements
 
Why not use absolute xpath - bc we have to start with the root node and lets say im traversing through the element 20 and in 
the middle element 15 is removed my xpath will be broken it will not work.

xPath functions:
CONTAINS -> //tagName[contains(@class, 'login_whatever')]

STARTS-WITH -> //tagName[starts-with(@class, 'login')]

ENDS-WITH -> //tagName[ends-with(@class, 'login')]

cssSelector Syntax:
tagName[attribute='value']
(input[id='Login'])(input[class='login'])

shorter way
id --> tagName#idValue (ex: input#login)
class --> tagName.classValue (ex: input.login)

CSS FUNCTIONS
contains -> tagName[attribute*='value]

starts with -> tagName[attribute^='startValue]

ends with -> tagName[attribute$="endValue']
