Webtables is another element in the user interface, it's basically a group
of object/elements represented in the form of rows and columns.

Table contains ROWS and COLUMNS

1. Static Tables
2. Dynamic Tables

<table>
	<thead>
	
		<tr>
			<th>FirstName</th>
			<th>LastName</th>
			</tr>
	</thead> 
	
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>John</td>
			<td>Smith</td>
	</tbody>
	
</table>

How do you handle dynamic webtables?

Scenario 1: 
- to verify some value is there
- identify table 
- get all rows and store in the collection
- loop through collection of rows
- get text of each row and use if condition
- break;

If data is no there in the first page?
- move to the next page

If you try to click on the element and you cannot perform click
use JavaScript Executor

How do you get object of JsExecutor?
By downcasting, downcasting driver

? If you try to click on element and element is not clickable?
I can use JSExecutor by downcasting my driver.
JavaScripExecutor js = (JavaScriptExecutor) driver;

+ grab the rows again, everything is a unique webelement
