What is Selenium?
A suite of tools. An open source, automation tool to automate web based applications across different browsers and platforms.

Using Selenium 3.14

What do we do before we start automating?
First, start manual testing. Create a test case passes manually. If it fails manually than you will reproduce it 
and than report the bug.

System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "path to the driver");
WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(); 

Commands to performs on browsers/page
get(String url); completes until page is loaded and will not keep the history of the browser
.navigate(); gives us history to go back and forth and will not wait for the page to load
		.back();
		.forward();
		.refresh();
.close(); closes the current page
.quit(); closes all the browsers that has been opened by instance of driver
getTitle();
getCurrentUrl();
manage.window.maximize();

WEB ELEMENTS: textbox, radio buttons, checkBoxes, links, drop down list, images, frames

How to interact with WebElements?
to interact with WebElements,  we would first to need to locate them.

How are elements written in the DOM? 
it always starts with tagName, followed by attribute and appropriate value
<tagName attribute="value">
ex: <div, frame, input, button, a, select> every element has to be unique to be easily identified

What's an attribute?
It's a key value pair that provides additional info about the HTML element.

Locators: 8
name
ID
tagName
className
xPath
CSS Selector
linkText
partialLinkText

why 8? bc developers might not provide that attribute to identify the element so we would have to use another locator

ex: <human name="John", lastName="Smith">Good Tester</human>
<human name="John", lastName="Smith">Good Developer</human>
finding the element by xpath if there are duplicates 

//human[text()='Good Developer'] 

Types of xPath?
1. Absolute - starts at the root node, uses only a single slash and can only go forward not backwards
2. Relative - can start from anywhere in the DOM, uses double slash


using INPUT - can create radio buttons, check boxes, - getting input from the user

Lets create a button with type=button and value=login
<button type="submit", value=login> </button>

xPath 
//button[@value='login']

css
button[value='login']

<button type="submit", value"login123"></button>
/xPath
//button[starts-with(@value, 'login')]
//button[contains[@value, 'login')]

css
button[value^='login']
button[value*='login']
button[value$='123'] ends with

Why use FUNCTIONS?
if the code changes dynamically.. esp with numbers
if the value of the elements contains any numbers


Commands to perform on WebElements
.getText();
.sendKeys(String key); - to send a text 
.getAttribute(); - to get the value of the attribute
.isEnabled();
.isSelected();
.isDisplayed();
.click();
.findElement();
.findElements();
.submit();
.clear();

FindElememts();
this method will return a list of WebElements


Handle RadioButtons and CheckBoxes 
If just one radiobutton or checkbox - just CLICK

If GROUP of radiobuttons or checkboxes - collect in a list by using common attribute
and then loop through each element

Handle DROP DOWNS
Use SELECT class only if element is written using select tag.

Select obj = new Select(must be an obj of select type); otherwise you will get an exception

select by visibleText
select by valueAttribute
select by index

TEXTBOX:
first clear and than sendText();

ALERTS:
Types of Alerts
Web based/Java Script Alerts

Selenium is a automation tool that can handle when it comes to the windows popup

We have an alert interface. Selenium provides us with an interface to help us handle the alerts. 

Type Of Alerts?
Alert Box - accept
Confirm Box - select yes or no
Prompt Box - send text

Alert alert = driver.switchTo().alert();
gives us one alert obj... this obj is of alert type
once we have obj of alert type this obj has access to all methods that are within the alert interface

there are 4 methods
dismiss();
accept();
sendText();
getText();


Handle FRAMES

We need to switch into a frame where element is located!
driver.switchTo().frame(WebElement);
driver.switchTo().frame(name or ID);
driver.switchTo().frame(index); should be the last option


Logic of getting text from 3 different frames
1. switch to frame
2. perform action inside the frame
3. switch to default content
4. switch to frame 2
5. perform action inside the frame 2
6. switch to default content
7. perform action on the main page

How to handle frames IQ:

"First I will have to identify the frame, once I identify the frame, I will have to switch to the frame by its name or ID, 
if the name or ID is not provided, I will identify, store it inside web element and switch it perform what ever 
action i need and i will have to switch it to default content"

How to switch to the main content:
driver.switchTo().defaultContent();

Handle Multiple Windows:

getWindowHandles(); - gets set of windows ID sessions 
getWindowHandle() - gets 1 window ID session currently open by webdriver instance

Logic to handle windows:
1. identify parent ID
2. collect all window handles - getWindowHandles();
3. iterate through each ID 
		if(!id.equals(parentID)){
		driver.switchTo().window(id);
		driver.getTitle();
		driver.close();
		driver.switchTo().window(parent);
		
.switchTo();
helps to switch between windows, frames, and alerts.

 
What is software testing?
It's a process to identify the correctness, completeness, and quality of a 
developed computer software. It includes a set of activities conducted with
the intent of finding errors so it can be corrected before the product is released
to the end user.

How to find errors?
Manual testing and automation testing.

When do you go for Test Automation?
1. When the environment is stable
2. When manual test passes
3. Analyzing test cases and identifying the best suite for automation.

What tool to use for test automation?
Selenium WebDriver, Katalon Stidue, UFT/QT

Levels Of Software Testing.
1. Unit testing done by developers
2. Integration Testing
3. System Testing
4. UAT Testing

Types of Software Testing
1. Functional Testing



2. Non Functional Testing
 a. performance testing - load testing, stress testing
 	Tools used: jMeter, WebLoad, Stress Stimulus, etc
 b. Security testing
 	Tools Used: Arachni, Iron-Wasp, Graber
 

Document Object Model (DOM)

radio/checkbox:
	identify the element using any locator
	check if it's enabled/selected
	click
	

radio/checkbox GROUP:
	-identify group by using common attribute and store inside the list
	-loop through the list and retrieve value/text of each element
	using if condition compare if value that we want to select matches
	the value from element - click -> break

DD with select tag
	identify element using any locator
	create an object of select class
	get all options
	loop through all options
	if text is there and matches text that we need to select
	then will call method .selectByVisibleText();
